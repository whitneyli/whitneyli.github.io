  <p> Mostly on building damages in earthquake, but 'there is at least 20 or 30 times more data out there from other disasters that we would like to have access to in order to continue training the algorithms,' Dyke said. 'By expanding the diversity of disasters we can make the algorithms more applicable to all sorts of data from all over the world, and thatâ€™s what we are trying to do.'

  	We are developing novel machine learning approaches to data fusion, that combine all this data together, removing unreliable data, identifying informative sources to generate maps, reports, of where help is needed, what help is needed and where help is available.  This information is passed to first responders, NGOs (e.g. insurance providers), National Disaster Management Agencies, farmers and others affected by the disaster to help formulate policy and plan response effectively, efficiently and accurately.

	Deep Learning for Emergency Response and Crisis Management Teams:
	Project DeepEye accepts the challenge of identifying a natural disaster in satellite images and enriching the data obtained in this way with multi-media content from social media.
